	<h2 > Introduction </h2>
	<p id='indent'> In the past couple of years, the American entertainment industry took a massive turn. It was found </p>
	<p> that younger generations were not as interested in traditional forms of media as previous generations. </p>
	<p> A new industry that is begining to emerge is eSports, or Competitive Gaming. eSports is seen by many </p>
	<p> as a flop ready to happen, haver we are compiling this report to compare this new industry to a pre-existing </p>
	<p> industy, traditional sports, through statistics. </p>

<h2> Money and Viewers </h2>
<div>
<p id= "indent"> In the world of entertainment, there are no two more important statsitcs than money and viewers. </p>
<p> Prize money attracts viewers, and it helps legitamize a pro scene in anything. We wanted to compare how the </p>
<p> money in eSports aligns with prize money in traditional sports (not factoring in salaries). We then also </p>
<p> compared pure viewership of multiple sports and games to see how they stack up. </p>

	<h4> Analysis</h4>
	<p id='indent'> The first chart shows that compared to traditional sports, eSports provides the same amount of money</p>
	<p> to winners, as both the highest earners make similar amounts. Although the other sports numbers differ, the </p>
	<p> money is very comparable. Viewers however, are a different story. The Champions League and NFL pull a much </p>
	<p> larger pool viewers compared to eSports, but other sports are similar to eSports. This further legatimizes esports </p>

	<h2> Demographics </h2>
	<body>
		<p id='indent'> An important point of eSports to look at is the unique demographic it is able to connect with.</p>
		<p> These following graphics explore the demographics of eSports compared to traditional sports. </p>

<h4 > Analysis</h4>
<p id='indent'>These pie graphs show that compared to traditional sports, eSports are more capable of reaching </p>
<p> out to a new type of audience. eSports are much more capable of reaching out to a younger audience,</p>
<p> however when it comes to reaching out to both sexes, sports is more effective. eSports struggles </p>
<p> greatly with an older audience, however as time passes this percentage will rise. </p>

		<h2 id='growthhead'> Growth Comparision </h2>
		<p id='indent'> The next two graphs compare the growth rate to the most popular sports and eSports </p>
		<p> championships in America, The League of Legends World Championship, and the Super Bowl. The first</p>
		<p> graph is a line graph that compares the total viewship of both events over six years, and the second</p>
		<p>graph looks at the percent growth per year. </p>

			<h4>Analysis</h4>
			<p id = 'indent'> When first looking at this data, it is alarming to see how many more viewers the </p>
			<p> Super Bowl has compared to League of Legends. The difference is so large, that it can be difficult</p>
			<p> to even read the earlier League data points. By looking at the third graph, it can be seen that the </p>
			<p> inital growth of League was Tremendous, however more recently the growth has slown down.</p>
			<p> Compared to the Super Bowl However, it is still growing a lot. </p>

		<h2> Conclusion </h2>
			<p id = "indent"> In summary, this data leads us to believe that eSports are rising in today’s society.</p>
			<p> Eventually, within the next few decades, eSports will be just as relevant as traditional sports such</p>
			<p>as football, basketball, soccer, and baseball. </p>
