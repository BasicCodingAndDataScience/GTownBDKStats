	<h2> Introduction </h2>
	<p id='indent'> In the past couple of years, the American entertainment industry took a massive turn. It was found </p>
	<p> that younger generations were not as interested in traditional forms of media as previous generations. </p>
	<p> A new industry that is begining to emerge is eSports, or Competitive Gaming. eSports is seen by many </p>
	<p> as a flop ready to happen, haver we are compiling this report to compare this new industry to a pre-existing </p>
	<p> industy, traditional sports, through statistics. </p>
	
	<p id='indent'> We decided to chose this topic so that we could indicate the rise in eSports, </p>
	<p> and how they could possibly surpass traditional sports in terms of viewership.

<h4> Analysis</h4>
<p id='indent'>These pie graphs show that compared to tradiional sports, eSports are more capable of reaching </p>
<p> out to a new type of audience. eSports are much more capable of reaching out to a younger audience,</p>
<p> however when it comes to reaching out to both sexes, sports is more effective. eSports struggles </p>
<p> greatly with an older audience, however as time passes this percentage will rise. </p>
